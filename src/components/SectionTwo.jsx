      React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source
      front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI
      components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community
      of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a
      base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However,
      React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to
      the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
      additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
      functionality.[7] Contents 1 Basic usage 2 Notable features 2.1
